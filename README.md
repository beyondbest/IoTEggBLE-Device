# IoTEggBLE-Device

This example is compatible with ICS IoT Egg device (mbed lpc1768). 

The IoT Egg is an integrated sensor suite which has been developed by Institute for 
Communication Systems (ICS) http://www.surrey.ac.uk/ics/, University of Surrey. At its core is an ARM Cortex M3 microprocessor (LPC1768). For more information of IoT Egg, please contact to Professor Klaus Moessner <k.moessner@surrey.ac.uk> or Dr. William Headley <w.headley@surrey.ac.uk>

Temperature and humidity values are sending to IoTEggBLE (Android App https://github.com/beyondbest/IoTEggBLE-Android/) via BLE. And it can change the RGB LED color by receiving LED value from IoTEggBLE (Android App) via BLE.
